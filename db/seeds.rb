# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#
# frank = User.create(
#   first_name: 'Frank',
#   last_name: 'TheTank',
#   email: 'frank@email.com',
#   password: 'password'
# )
#
# counter = frank.counters.build(
#   title: 'Push-Ups'
# )
# counter.save
#
# entry = counter.entries.build(
#   quantity: 99
# )
# entry.save
